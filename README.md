It manufactures, sells and markets soft drinks including Coca-Cola, other non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. Its stock is listed on the NYSE and is part of the DJIA and the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indexes.
Coca-Cola was developed in 1886 by pharmacist John Stith Pemberton. At the time it was introduced, the product contained cocaine from coca leaves and caffeine from kola nuts which together acted as a stimulant. The data file contains a record of sale operation for various retailers between year 2022 and 2023.

#### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
 - Measuring the performance of employees is a great approach to selecting and appointing task and resposibilities to employees. However, Teron Corp organization should regularly consider chosing the employee with the following criteria rather than just comparing performance to help improve recruitment strategies.
   (a) Emotional intelligence
   (b) Technical and IT expertise
   (c) Team spirit and collaborating strength
   (d) Degree of commitment
 - Encourage that the source of hire shouldn't be the only metrics to measure the performance of an employee.
 - Put into Consideration the educational background and skills acquisition as a possible contribute to employee perfromance.
